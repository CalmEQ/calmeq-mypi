1. Simplify the wifi setup
2. Store 36 hours worth of audio
3. Asyncrenous push of processed data


lets try spinning up a webserver, and putting a php form up to list and then
add wifi info to server. The web server can also list current recordings, 
and other status updates

alternatively we power everything off the devices page, but i think that would
be a bit awkward, and not leave open the backdoors that we want to configure 
the devices
